# Blacklist Benchmark Solution

This solution provides a comprehensive benchmark of different blacklist validation methods with minimal-impact monitoring in Azure.

## Methods Compared

1. Bloom Filter
2. Cuckoo Filter
3. Ultra-Fast BitArray
4. Two-Level Cache

## Performance Monitoring

- Lightweight Application Insights integration
- Adaptive sampling (10% in production)
- Async monitoring with minimal impact
- Custom performance metrics

## Azure Deployment

The solution deploys to Azure Free tier with:
- App Service (F1)
- Redis Cache (Basic)
- Application Insights

### Deployment Steps

1. Create Azure resources:
```bash
az deployment group create --resource-group <your-rg> --template-file infrastructure/main.bicep
```

2. Configure Azure DevOps pipeline:
- Create a new pipeline
- Select Azure Repos Git
- Select this repository
- Configure pipeline using existing azure-pipelines.yml

## Local Development

1. Start the solution:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Run benchmarks:
```bash
cd src_net/BombardierTests
./run_tests.sh
```

## Performance Optimization

All methods are optimized for maximum performance:
- Ultra-Fast BitArray for nanosecond-level operations
- Cuckoo Filter with optimized hash functions
- Two-Level Cache with efficient synchronization
- Minimal-impact monitoring

## Monitoring Impact

The monitoring system is designed to have negligible impact on performance:
- 10% sampling rate in production
- Async metric collection
- Optimized telemetry
- Disabled non-essential counters
